Scheme interpreters written in python, c, and rust

I have three objectives/reasons for doing this project:
- Continue my study of the functional programming and the lisp family of languages in general 
- Familiarize myself with the "essence" of interpreters
- Learn the Rust programming language.
 
I was inspired to begin this after reading a medium post by user Stepan Parunashvili, who in turn was inspired by an article written by Peter Norvig entitled "(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))"
